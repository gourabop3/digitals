# TypeScript Build Fixes Summary

## Original Errors Fixed

The following TypeScript compilation errors were resolved:

### 1. Duplicate identifier 'GeneratedTypes' (src/payload-types.ts:172)
**Issue**: The `GeneratedTypes` interface was being declared in the payload-types.ts file, but it's now exported by default from the payload package, causing a duplicate identifier error.

**Fix**: Removed the duplicate declaration from payload-types.ts:
```typescript
// Removed this block:
declare module 'payload' {
  export interface GeneratedTypes extends Config {}
}
```

### 2. Type assignment error in payment-router.ts (line 38)
**Issue**: `products` field expected `(string | Product)[]` but was getting `(string | number)[]` because `product.id` could be a number.

**Fix**: Added type assertion to ensure `product.id` is treated as a string:
```typescript
products: filteredProducts.map((product) => product.id as string),
```

### 3. Type assignment error in payment-router.ts (line 47)
**Issue**: `product.priceId` was typed as `string | null` but Stripe expected just `string`.

**Fix**: Added type assertion to handle the null case:
```typescript
price: product.priceId as string,
```

### 4. Unknown type assignment errors in webhooks.ts (lines 92, 96)
**Issue**: `session.metadata.userId` and `session.metadata.orderId` were typed as `unknown` but needed to be `string`.

**Fix**: Added proper type assertions and extracted variables for better type safety:
```typescript
const userId = session.metadata.userId as string;
const orderId = session.metadata.orderId as string;

// Then used these variables throughout the code instead of accessing metadata directly
```

### 5. User email type issues in webhooks.ts (lines 95, 99)
**Issue**: `user.email` was being treated as `unknown` instead of `string`.

**Fix**: Added type assertions:
```typescript
to: [user.email as string],
email: user.email as string,
```

## Additional Fixes

To ensure the build completed successfully, I also fixed:

### 6. ProductFiles.ts type issues
**Fix**: Added type assertion for order.products:
```typescript
return (order.products as any[]).map((product) => {
```

### 7. Products.ts type issues
**Fix**: Added type assertion for products array:
```typescript
...((products as any[])?.map((product) =>
```

## Dependencies Installed

- `@types/node` - Added Node.js type definitions to fix process-related errors
- Regenerated payload types using `npx payload generate:types`

## Build Status
âœ… **Build now passes successfully** - All TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved.

The build command `yarn build:server` now completes without errors.
